Spanning Tree and minimum spanning tree

Spanning Tree: 
    which can Cover all vertices with min possible edges
    St is a subset of a graph ()
    St cannot be disconnected (disconnectd graph we can never able to cover all the vertices)
    Graph should be single-component
    
    No of vertices = V
    no of edges    = V-1  (no of vertices -1 always)
    
    we don't have any cycles in a ST
    All STs will have same number of edges
    A connected and undirected graph has atleast 1ST
    A complete undirected graph has N^(N-2) no of different ST's possible (N is number of vertices)
    A ST is minimally connected ie. removing 1 edge will disconnect the graph
    A ST is maximally Acyclic ie. adding 1 edge will form a cycle in graph
    
    
Minimum spanning Tree:
    A spnning tree with min cost in a weighted graph is called MST(cost = cost of all edges)
    There can be more than one MST
    
APPLICATIONS:
    Design network cable route for cities using minimum cable, hence minimizing cost
    Design water supply n/w, transportation n/w etc, read wiki

Prims : this is a greedy type MST finding algorithm
    Goal 1: cover all vertices
    Goal 2: cover with minimum cost
    
1. select min value option first

Steps:
    All node weights are inf except source , since we need to select source first
    1. Select Node with min-weight (start at source)
    2. include selected node in setMST
    3. Relax/compure all adjacent edges
    -----repeat  -->1-->2-->3-->  unless all vertices are included in MST
    
notes:
    We started from node 0 and we are expanding only adjacently and not randomly(like kruskals)
    
Requirements:
    We need to keep track of weight values for all nodes  : use array (size V)
    we nned to know what vertices are included in MST      : boor array (size V)
    We need to remember edges of MST to print finally     : parent array (size V)
        a. Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has a minimum key value. 
        b. Include u to mstSet. 
        c.Update key value of all adjacent vertices of u. To update the key values, 
            iterate through all adjacent vertices. For every adjacent vertex v, if the weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key value as the weight of u-v

    dist    :   0  inf   inf   inf   inf  inf
    mstSET  :   F   F     F     F     F    F
    parent  :  -1
    
either use ADJ-list or ADJ-matrix

The Time Complexity of the above program is O(V^2). 
If the input graph is represented using adjacency list, then the time complexity of Primâ€™s algorithm can be reduced to 
O(E log V) with the help of a binary heap.
